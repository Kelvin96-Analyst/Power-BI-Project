## üéØ Project Objective

This project involved the analysis of sales and marketing data collected over a 3-month period, using Power BI to deliver valuable insights into campaign effectiveness, regional sales trends, and the return on investment (ROI) from marketing efforts.
The core objective was to design and develop an interactive Power BI dashboard and report capable of answering the following key performance questions:

- What are the **total sales** and **average sales**?
- What are the **total sales across regions**?
- What is the **total number of orders** placed?
- What is the **total and monthly marketing expenditure**?
- How have **sales changed over time**, and how do they correlate with marketing spending?
- Which **region performed best**, and how did rankings evolve?

## üìä Data Analysis and Visualization in Power BI

Using Power BI, we analyzed the dataset and created a set of interactive visual dashboards to answer the KPI questions.

| Visual Type        | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Card Visuals**   | Showcased Total Sales, Average Sales, Total Orders, and Total Marketing Spend |
| **Multi-Row Cards**| Displayed Sales and Marketing Spend by Month|
| **Waterfall Chart**| Illustrated the flow of Monthly Marketing Spend contributing to Total Spend |
| **Ribbon Chart**   | Highlighted Regional Sales Performance and how their rankings changed over the campaign period |

## üìà Key Insights
Based on the analysis conducted in Power BI, the following key insights and trends were identified:
  
- **Total and average sales**: The total sales for the business across the 3 (three) states from May to July amount to approximately $1.8 million, with an average monthly sale of approximately $88.82K per order.

- **Sales across regions**: When looking at the states breakdown from the ribbon chart, Abuja and Lagos (Team Alpha) have higher sales when compared to Delta and Enugu (Team Omega), indicating better overall performance.

- **Number of orders**: The total number of distinct orders placed during this period is around 20. This provides an insight into the volume of transactions that were processed.

- **Marketing expenditure**: The total marketing expenditure during this period amounts to about $276K. In a monthly breakdown, marketing spend has seen a consistent increase which aligns with the objective of driving up sales.

- **Sales and marketing expenditure relationship**: The waterfall chart indicates a positive correlation between sales and marketing spending. As the marketing expenditure increased, sales also grew. However, the Ads campaigns run by Team Alpha were more successful than Team Omega. An extra $98,000 spent on marketing brought approximately $745K of sales for Team Alpha in July. On the other hand, an extra $88,000 marketing budget brought only $331K in sales for Team Omega in July.

- **Region performance and ranking**: The ribbon chart reveals that Abuja and Lagos (Team Alpha) consistently performed the best in terms of sales. However, even with substantial advertising spend, Delta and Enugu (Team Omega) did not perform proportionally well in sales, indicating potential issues with their advertising campaigns.
