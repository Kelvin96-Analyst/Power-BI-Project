## üéØ Objective

This project involved the analysis of sales and marketing data collected over a 3-month period, using Power BI to deliver valuable insights into campaign effectiveness, regional sales trends, and the return on investment (ROI) from marketing efforts.
The core objective was to design and develop an interactive Power BI dashboard and report capable of answering the following key performance questions:

- What are the **total sales** and **average sales**?
- What are the **total sales across regions**?
- What is the **total number of orders** placed?
- What is the **total and monthly marketing expenditure**?
- How have **sales changed over time**, and how do they correlate with marketing spending?
- Which **region performed best**, and how did rankings evolve?

## üìä Data Analysis and Visualization in Power BI

Using Power BI, we analyzed the dataset and created a set of interactive visual dashboards to answer the KPI questions.

| Visual Type        | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Card Visuals**   | Showcased Total Sales, Average Sales, Total Orders, and Total Marketing Spend |
| **Multi-Row Cards**| Displayed Sales and Marketing Spend by Month|
| **Waterfall Chart**| Illustrated the flow of Monthly Marketing Spend contributing to Total Spend |
| **Ribbon Chart**   | Highlighted Regional Sales Performance and how their rankings changed over the campaign period |

- **Total Sales**: ~$1.04 million  
- **Average Monthly Sale per Order**: ~$64.75K  
- **Total Orders**: 16  
- **Total Marketing Spend**: ~$126K  

- **East and South (Team B)** significantly outperformed North and West (Team A)
- **Marketing ROI** was higher for Team B; e.g., in July:
  - $17K extra spend led to $223K sales (Team B)
  - $20K extra spend led to $65K sales (Team A)
- **East Region** maintained the highest sales rank throughout the campaign
- **West Region's** marketing spend did not yield proportionate sales, suggesting inefficiencies
